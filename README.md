# Trailing Your Trail
Embarking on a journey into the wilderness should be an immersive experience, free from distractions. Recognizing this, our project aims to enhance the outdoor adventure by eliminating the need to frequently consult oneâ€™s phone for navigational assurance.  

Our initiative seeks to resolve this issue by introducing a discreet, vibration-based notification system that signals users only when necessary, thereby preserving the continuity of their experience.
